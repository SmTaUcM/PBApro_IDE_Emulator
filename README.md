#  PBA.Pro Python IDE Emulation
A Python wrapper module to allow Python scripting of bespoke PBA.Pro class objects in any IDE.

- **Description:** PBA.Pro is bespoke databus analysis software that features Python scripting. The software itself features a built in IDE but is extremely rudimentary and is similar to programming in notepad. To aid my team in being able to script for this software utilising any off the shelf Python IDE, I created this wrapper class to emulate all PBA.Pro script functionality and include features such as intellisense. This module allows users to run their PBA.Pro scripts within their IDE of choice allowing them to spot errors quickly and have full docstring intellisense. The module also features persistent object creation, meaning that an object can be created multiple times while maintaining its attributes.

- **What I Learned:** In this project I learned how to process and parse XML data into a Python runtime, persistently store information pending itâ€™s request and make a valuable Python module.
